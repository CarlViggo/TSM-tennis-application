
"""
A) Retrieve information: front-end. 
    1. Enter number of vertices (tennisballs)
    2. Enter speed. 
    3. Enter measurements. 
    4. Enter pickup-time. 

B) Graph: back-end. 
    1. Create two gaussian ball-distribution for each court. 
    2. Create connected graph. These will be two graphs, because of the tennisnet 
    separating the court. 
    3. Calculate minimum spanning trees. 
    4. Calculate time. 

Run program: 
    1. Run A. 
    2. Display court. 
    3. Run B. 
    4. Display minimum spanning tree. 
    5. Display time. 
    6. Ask to run program again or quit.
